moonmoji
========
Return an emoji representing the current moon phase.

Installation
------------
Clone the repo  
`npm install`  
Run it: `node path/to/index.js`

In your bash
------------
The main goal of this was to have the emoji display in a shell. This can be accomplished by adding the script to your `PS1` export in your `.bash_prompt` or similar, eg: `PS1=$(node path/to/index.js); export PS1;`

Example:
