moonmoji
========
Return an emoji representing the current moon phase.

Installation
------------
Clone the repo  
`npm install`  
Run it: `node path/to/index.js`

CLI
---
```sh
$ npm install --global moonmoji
```

```sh
$ moonmoji --help

  Return an emoji representing the current moon phase.

  Usage
    moonmoji
    => `ðŸŒ—`

    moonmoji -v
    => `Last Quarter - ðŸŒ—`
```

In your bash
------------
The main goal of this was to have the emoji display in a shell. This can be accomplished by adding the script to your `PS1` export in your `.bash_profile` or similar, eg:  

`PS1=$(node path/to/index.js);`  
`export PS1;`

Example:

* note: If you have additional information in your `PS1` you'll need to have two spaces after the emoji character.
